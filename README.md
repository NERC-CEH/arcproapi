# arcproapi
A wrapper for ESRI ArcGIPro. Adapted from the arcapi repo.

Very much still under development and subject to bugs etc.

Took the arcapi repo and moved into modules and changed for both Python 3 compatibility and ArcGISPro arcpy

Several modules are still left as-is from the original arcpro API because I have not yet had call to .. call them.

# docstrings
Uses Google's Python Docstring standard. I am slowly sorting out docstrings on an adhoc database.

See https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html for practical usage.

The intention is to automate documentation production using Sphinx.
